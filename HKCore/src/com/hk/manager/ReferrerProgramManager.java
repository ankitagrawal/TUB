/**
 * User: rahul Time: 22 Apr, 2010 3:46:20 PM <p/> A User can earn Reward Points in 2 ways 1.) Adding reward points
 * directly to the user's account through admin. 2.) Reward Points by referring others users through a special coupon
 * code containing a referrer user id and when referred user will order something then reward points will be added to
 * the user's account. <p/> <p/> Reward points added by 2nd method are subject to admin approval. So whenever reward
 * points are added to the user's account, they are in pending state. Admin has to approve these points manually. On
 * approval a reward point txn will be created of the type add. Reward point has an expiry date associated with it.
 * After that date user can not redeem them i.e reward point will be expired. <p/> At any given time total redeemable
 * points will be the balance of all the active i.e not expired reward points txns Example: Value Expiry-Date
 * Reward-Point-Type +50 6-May-2010 Add +50 7-May-2010 Add -25 6-May-2010 Redeem <p/> so on 5-May-2010 total redeemable
 * points will be +75 and on 7-May-2010 total redeemable points will be 50 and on 8-May-2010 total redeemable points
 * will be 0 <p/> Reward points can be directly used to pay for the order i.e if the order total is Rs 500 and user has
 * 100 reward points then if he uses his reward points and the total billable amount will be Rs 400 To keep track of
 * reward points used in an order we have a field in order named "rewardPointsUsed". And also an invoiceLine will be
 * created of the type RewardPoint whenever an order uses reward points to checkout. <p/> <p/>
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Redeem Reward Points Logic Whenever user
 * redeem his reward points a reward point txn of the type redeem will be created. To redeem the points we will find all
 * the active txns group by reward point and sorted by expiry date asc. i.e reward points having expiry date earlier
 * will be redeemed first. <p/> ----------------------------------------------------------------------- We can not
 * redeem more than added value from a reward point Example: If reward points with value +50 and +100 are added, then it
 * does not mean that we can reddem more than 50 points from the reward point whose value is 50. In short, an individual
 * reward point balance can not be less than zero <p/> <p/>
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------- <p/> Cancelling the order where reward points
 * were used: Since we are keeping track of the redeemed reward points i.e in which order they are redeemed so if an
 * order is cancelled where part/total amount was paid by reward points then on cancellation of the order we will refund
 * the redeemed reward points. <p/> ----------------------------------------------------------------------- <p/>
 * Cancellation of the referred order: Referred order is the order due to which reward points will be added to the
 * user'd account. So on cancellation of such an order. Reward points credited will also be cancelled. In normal cases
 * when user has not used those reward points which were added due to this cancelled order then a reward point txn of
 * the type cancel with the same value as the added will be created. But if user has somehow used these reward points
 * then this used points/amount will be taken by cancelling other rewward points of that user. In case, to be cancelled
 * points are more than the total reddemable points then these overusedRewardPoints will be stored in user account info
 * and will be charged whenever new reward points will be added to the user's account. So at any given time balance of
 * the reward point in reward point txn table can not be less than zero. And if any overused reward points are there,
 * they will be stored seperately in user account info and taken into account whenever a new reward point will be added
 * to the user's account <p/> Example: Value Expiry-Date Reward-Point-Type Reward-Point-Id +50 6-May-2010 Add 1 +50
 * 7-May-2010 Add 2 -50 6-May-2010 Redeem 1 -26 7-May-2010 Redeem 2 <p/> Now suppose the reward point with id 1 is
 * cancelled so we have to take these reward points back but user has already used them. Now to take these points back
 * we will cancel other reward points. Since 24 points in reward-point-id 2 is un-used so will deduct those 24 points
 * from reward point 2 as cancelled points and rest amount i.e 26 will be stored in user account info <p/> Value
 * Expiry-Date Reward-Point-Type Reward-Point-Id +50 6-May-2010 Add 1 +50 7-May-2010 Add 2 -50 6-May-2010 Redeem 1 -26
 * 7-May-2010 Redeem 2 -24 7-May-2010 Cancel 2 <p/> And overusedRewardPoint = 26, redeemablePoints = 0 <p/> Now suppose
 * that in future user gets some more reward points then we can deduct the overused reward points from these newly added
 * reward points <p/> Value Expiry-Date Reward-Point-Type Reward-Point-Id +50 6-May-2010 Add 1 +50 7-May-2010 Add 2 -50
 * 6-May-2010 Redeem 1 -26 7-May-2010 Redeem 2 -24 7-May-2010 Cancel 2 +50 15-May-2010 Add 3 -26 15-May-2010 Cancel 3
 * <p/> And overusedRewardPoints = 0, redeemablePoints = 24
