--------------------------------------CONTENTS OF THE FOLDER TO BE UPLOADED---------------------------------------------
<br/><br/>
1)	The folder to be uploaded should be a .zip folder.
<br/>
2)	The .zip folder can contain only one .html file named 'emailer.html'. Also, this .html file must be directly placed
<br/>inside the .zip folder and not inside any other sub-folder.
<br/>
3)	The .html file should not contain the 'can't view this mail' and 'unsubscribe link' divs. These would be added later
<br/>on.
<br/>
4)	It would be suggested that a proper convention could be followed while creating the zip folders and the sub-folders
<br/>within.
<br/>
5)	The final .html file uploaded to the third party, contains the 'can't view this mail' and 'unsubscribe link'.
<br/>
6)	Images, once uploaded for the campaign, cannot be changed.
<br/>
7)	Only relative path of the .html file, that under an attribute of form 'img ...src="*relative path*" ....' or
<br/><....background-image="*relative path*"....>; would be converted to absolute paths acording to the directory structure
 <br/>developed while uplaoding at the third party. In case there arises any case where something needs  to added using a
 <br/>relative path and doesnot fit in the format does not fit in any of the above ideas, please inform the technical team
 <br/>to make relevamt changes.
