      <h2>Terms and conditions for HealthKart referral program</h2>

      <p>
        Following are the terms of the referral program by HealthKart.com, a property of Aquamarine HealthCare Pvt. Ltd.
        (hereinafter the "Company" or "HealthKart")
      </p>

      <h3><a name="validReferral"></a>Valid referrals</h3>

      <p>
        A valid referral is defined as follows :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          - The referred user is a new member of HealthKart
        </li>
        <li>
          - The order address (placed by the referred user) is of a new household. Orders to one shipping address
          will count for only one valid referral
        </li>
        <li>
          - The referred user is not a member of HealthKart via a different email address.
        </li>
        <li>
          - The referral is a 1-on-1 personal referral to a person known to the referee. Public sharing of coupons on
          deal sites and other media would not be counted as referrals. (Affiliate program is the appropriate channel
          for people who wish to make a commercial gain through sales of our products)
        </li>
        <li>
          - Each customer would be eligible to refer upto 10 friends â€“ any extension beyond 10 referrals would need to
          be requested for and applied for by email at info@healthkart.com
        </li>

        <li>- Referral coupon codes are not sitewide and are limited to selected categories.
            They may not be applicable on categories like diapers, baby food etc. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, a referral to us means a new customer who is personally introduced to our company by an existing
        customer. Any violation of this concept would not be considered for the incentive
      </p>

        the notice, the Program will terminate at 11:59 PM IST on the 5th calendar day following the day on which such
