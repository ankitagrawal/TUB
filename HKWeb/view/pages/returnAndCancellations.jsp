        information, paste the shipping address label on the package and courier it back to us. Please bear in mind that
        we should receive the return package within 10 days of us sending the authorizing email.

        Post receipt of the return package, we will proceed to inspect the same. Once approved as an eligible return, we
        will issue your refund or merchandise credit in the appropriate amount. If however the return is found not
        eligible for refund, we will courier the same back to you. In either scenario your return issue will be closed

        1. When we validate your return, we send you a return authorization mail <br/>
        2. At the closure of your refund, we send you a closure mail <br/>

        to be delivered to your billing address, and for the funds to be credited to your account, once you deposit the
        cheque.
